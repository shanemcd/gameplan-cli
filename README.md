## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shanemcd/gameplan-cli.git
cd gameplan-cli

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Verify installation
uv run gameplan --help
```

### Initialize Your Gameplan

```bash
# Create a new gameplan repository
uv run gameplan init

# This creates:
# - gameplan.yaml (configuration)
# - tracking/areas/jira/ (tracking directory)
```

### Configure Tracking

Edit `gameplan.yaml` to add items to track:

```yaml
areas:
  jira:
    items:
      - issue: "PROJ-123"
        env: "prod"
      - issue: "PROJ-456"
        env: "stage"

agenda:
  sections:
    - name: "Focus & Priorities"
      emoji: "🎯"
      description: "What's urgent/important today"

    - name: "Calendar"
      emoji: "📅"
      command: "date"
      description: "Today's schedule"

    - name: "Notes"
      emoji: "📔"
      description: "Thoughts and observations"
```

### Create Your Daily Agenda

```bash
# Initialize AGENDA.md
uv run gameplan agenda init

# View your agenda
uv run gameplan agenda view

# Update command-driven sections
uv run gameplan agenda refresh
```

---

## 📖 Usage

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new gameplan
gameplan init
gameplan init -d ~/my-gameplan    # Initialize in specific directory

# Manage daily agenda
gameplan agenda init              # Create AGENDA.md
gameplan agenda view              # Display current agenda
gameplan agenda refresh           # Update command-driven sections

# Sync tracked items
gameplan sync                     # Sync all configured adapters
gameplan sync jira                # Sync Jira only
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize your gameplan
cd ~/projects
uv run gameplan init

# 2. Configure your items to track (edit gameplan.yaml)
#    Add Jira issues, configure agenda sections

# 3. Create your daily agenda
uv run gameplan agenda init

# 4. Work throughout the day
#    - Edit AGENDA.md to add focus items, notes
#    - Run `gameplan agenda refresh` to update calendar/commands

# 5. Sync Jira data
uv run gameplan sync jira
```

## 🗂️ Project Structure

After initialization, your gameplan repository looks like:

```
my-gameplan/
├── gameplan.yaml              # Configuration
├── AGENDA.md                  # Daily agenda (after agenda init)
└── tracking/
    └── areas/
        └── jira/
            ├── PROJ-123-fix-api-bug/
            │   └── README.md      # Issue details + your notes
            └── archive/
                └── (completed items)
```

### gameplan.yaml

The configuration file defines what to track and how your agenda works:

```yaml
areas:
  jira:
    items:
      - issue: "PROJ-123"
        env: "prod"

agenda:
  sections:
    - name: "Focus & Priorities"
      emoji: "🎯"
      description: "What's urgent today"
      # Manual section - you edit this

    - name: "Calendar"
      emoji: "📅"
      command: "gcalcli agenda --tsv"
      description: "Today's meetings"
      # Command-driven - auto-populated
```

### AGENDA.md

Your daily command center, generated from `gameplan.yaml`:

```markdown
# Agenda - Wednesday, October 22, 2025

## 🎯 Focus & Priorities
[What's urgent/important today]

## 📅 Calendar
9:30am - Team Standup
2:00pm - Sprint Planning

## 📔 Notes
[Thoughts and observations]
```

### README.md (per tracked item)

Each tracked item gets its own README:

```markdown
# PROJ-123: Fix API Authentication Bug

**Status**: In Progress
**Assignee**: johndoe

## Overview
API authentication fails when using OAuth tokens due to...

## Notes
- Reproduced locally with test credentials
- Root cause: token expiration not handled
- Fix: Add refresh token logic
```

---

## 🔌 Adapters

Gameplan uses a pluggable adapter architecture. Each adapter integrates with an external tracking system.

### Available Adapters

**Jira Adapter** (Phase 4 - ✅ Complete)
- Syncs Jira issues via [jirahhh CLI](https://github.com/shanemcd/jirahhh)
- Fetches: status, assignee, summary
- Updates: README.md while preserving your notes
- Supports multiple Jira environments (prod/stage)

**Coming Soon**:
- GitHub adapter (issues, PRs)
- Linear adapter
- Generic REST API adapter

### Using the Jira Adapter

1. **Install jirahhh**:
   ```bash
   uvx jirahhh --help
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export JIRA_URL="https://your-jira.atlassian.net"
   export JIRA_EMAIL="you@example.com"
   export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-token"
   ```

3. **Add items to gameplan.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   areas:
     jira:
       items:
         - issue: "PROJ-123"
           env: "prod"
   ```

4. **Sync**:
   ```bash
   gameplan sync jira
   ```

## 🛠️ Development

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shanemcd/gameplan-cli.git
cd gameplan-cli

# Install development dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=cli --cov-report=term-missing

# View HTML coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=cli --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Project Philosophy

**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write tests first (RED phase)
- Implement minimum code to pass (GREEN phase)
- Refactor without changing behavior (REFACTOR phase)
- Maintain 85%+ overall coverage

**Git Commit Guidelines**:
- Follow [cbea.ms/git-commit](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
- Imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added"
- 50 char subject, 72 char body wrap
- Explain "what" and "why", not "how"

**Code Quality**:
- Type hints on all functions
- Docstrings on all public APIs
- Comprehensive error handling
- Idempotent operations

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for detailed guidelines.
